Don't get me wrong, I like his theory (and evolution.) But <span class="persName">Dawkins</span> called a meme a unit of culture. Sounds squishy, doesn't it ?

That's because their books compress into my mini-page chunks. The behavior of the chunkd is what mattered to <span class="persName">Miller</span>, not the number. They <em>compress, nest, and scale.</em></p> <p>Scaling means that the <em>riot <span class="corr">[girl]</span></em> concept can go from zine idea to cultural Thing. If copied and shared, the information you're reading could compress-nest-scale, too. It would no longer be 6 chunks about <em><span class="persName">Miller</span>, mirroring, and memetics.</em> It would become one idea, a Zine Theory, told in one word: <em>zinetics.</em></p></li></ul></section></div><!--TEI back--><div class="tei_back"><span class="docDate">Z_LXXXX</span> — <span class="docDate">10Aug2025</span><span class="docAuthor"><span class="persName"> Morgan Stern</span></span><h1>THE FORMAT (that functions)</h1><ul><li class="item">I.
